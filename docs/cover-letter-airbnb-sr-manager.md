Hello Hiring Team,

I’m applying for the Sr Manager role to help build Airbnb’s Brazil hub as an extension of the global infrastructure workforce—setting clear operating rhythms, developing leaders, and driving consistent execution across geographies.

I’m an Engineering Manager and Chapter Lead at Johnson & Johnson, with 15+ years of experience in software development. In my current scope, I manage **50+ engineers, being 9 internal employees and 40+ contractors**, balancing technical direction, delivery quality, and budget/vendor governance. My day-to-day leadership includes people management, budget management, interviews and onboarding, stakeholder alignments, and building strong engineering practices across teams.

From a technical standpoint, I’m hands-on with modern web and backend engineering and have experience across cloud, CI/CD, DevSecOps, and platform-oriented delivery—always with an emphasis on reliability and scalable ways of working. I also lead AI initiatives that improve SDLC quality and throughput, which aligns with your focus on tooling that raises reliability and execution standards.

I’d love to bring my experience to contribute to Airbnb goals, locally and globally.

My CV is available at **psneves.com.br**. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
**Paulo Neves**
